# rvre 

**NOTE:** This is not in any kind of working state!

RVRE (like "reverie!") is my toy RISC-V (RV32I) core for exploring ways of
implementing out-of-order machines. Ideally, this ends up being:

- Some kind of (ideally working, FPGA-synthesizable) soft RISC-V core
- Readable code and documentation about design choices

This project is written in [Amaranth](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth), 
mostly because it seemed less-painful to pick up than others.
