# rvre 

A RISC-V (RV32I) core implemented with [Amaranth HDL](https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth).

## Motivations

I'm using this project as an exercise for:

1. Becoming more comfortable with digital logic (i.e. using HDLs)
2. Exploring how things are implemented in modern microarchitectures
